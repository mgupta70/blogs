For this, we will use a dataframe containing purely numerical features for the task of classification. As our understanding about decision trees expands, we will extend the concepts learned here to handle complex and challenging dataframes (such as those with missing values, with categorical features, etc.)\nLet’s load the popular iris data. (We are using sklearn only and only to load a popular benchmark dataset. We will not use it to build decision trees. Instead, we will build our decision trees entirely from scratch in using numpy)\n\n# load the data\niris_data = load_iris()\nX = iris_data.data\ny = iris_data.target\n\n# Here X and y are numpy arrays. We do a bit of processing to convert X and y into pandas dataframe for readability\nfeature_names = iris_data.feature_names\ntarget_names = iris_data.target_names\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names) # start df with features i.e. X\ndf['target'] = y                            # add target column to df i.e. y\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\ntarget\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\n0\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\n0\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf['target'] = df['target'].apply(lambda x: target_names[x]) # Optional: convert integer labels to actual class names\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\ntarget\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will build a decision tree which when given 4 numerical feature values will classify the plant species as one of 'setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'.\nFor this, we first need to split the data into train and val sets. Then we will use the train set to build the model and test it on the val set.\n\ndef train_test_split_df(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):\n    \"\"\" splits the data into train and test sets\"\"\"\n\n    if isinstance(test_size, float) and test_size&lt;1:\n        test_size = int(len(df)*test_size)\n    elif isinstance(test_size, int):\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"test size must be a float/ int\")\n    \n    shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(len(df))\n    test_indices = shuffled_indices[:test_size]\n    test_df = df.iloc[test_indices]\n    train_df = df.drop(test_indices)\n    return train_df, test_df\n\n\ntrain_df, test_df = train_test_split_df(df, test_size=20, random_state=0)\nprint(f'Train size: {len(train_df)}, Test size: {len(test_df)}')\ntrain_df.head()\n\nTrain size: 130, Test size: 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\ntarget\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build a decision tree, the dataset is split into 2 subsets using a condition - where one subset satisfies the condition and another does not.\nThe condition is nothing but thresholding of one the features. (For example, condition: sepal lenghth &lt;= 4.4 cms will split the dataset into 2 subsets - one where sepal lenghth is less than 4.4 cms and another where it is not)\nThe main question here is how we decide which feature to use and what threshold to pick?\nAnswer: Pick the feature which results in most information gain.\nNow to understand the above term information gain, we need to first familiarize ourselves with few more concepts.\n\nPurity - Measure of homogenity of a subset. For ex: if a subset contains only red balls - it is pure. But if it contains even a single green ball - it is now impure. The extent of impurity is measured using entropy.\nEntropy - calculated as H(X) = — Σ (pi * log2 pi) where; X = Total number of samples pi is the probability of class i\n\nFor a pure subset: entropy = 0 for the most impure subset (i.e. half A class and half B class): entropy = 1\n\nInformation Gain - If we split the dataset, then the entropy (i.e. degree of impurity) in the children subsets should ideally be lower. This difference in entropy is the information gain.\n\nInformation Gain = entropy (parent) — [average entropy of ( children)]\nSo, based on the above concepts, we will split the dataset, using the feature that results in highest information gain.\nAnd how we do this?\nAnswer: Brute Force. Yes, Brute Force… We go through all the feature columns one at a time and for each feature column, we go through all of their possible values one at a time, splitting the data into 2 children nodes, calculating information gain, storing it and then pick one which gave us the highest information gain.\nWe repeat this process, either a fixed number of times or until the entropy of children becomes zero (i.e. children subsets become pure) and then we stop.\nLet’s see this step by step…\n\n# let's check the purity of our current data\n\ndef check_purity(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if data is pure.\n    \"\"\"\n    y = df.iloc[:, -1]\n    return len(y.unique())==1\n\nprint('Is the train data pure? -&gt;', check_purity(train_df))\n\nIs the train data pure? -&gt; False\n\n\nAs it is not pure. Let’s see how much impure it is by calculating entropy.\n\ndef calculate_entropy(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the entropy of the data. Entropy =  — Σ (pi * log2 pi)\n    \"\"\"\n    y = df.iloc[:, -1]\n    values, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)\n    probs = counts/len(y)\n    entropy = -np.sum(probs*np.log2(probs))\n    return entropy\n\nparent_entropy = calculate_entropy(train_df)\nprint(f\"Entropy of parent node: {parent_entropy}\")\n\nEntropy of parent node: 1.5843670011535813\n\n\nNow, let’s see the details of how we will split the data. The code below should be very straightforward and intuitive to understand.\nAs mentioned, now (1) we will go through all features and their all possible values to split the dataset and then (2)check the information gain. SO, let’s first create the function called get_potential_splits that does (1) for us and then we will implement determine_best_split that will do (2) for us.\n\ndef get_potential_splits(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Get all the possible potential splits of the data.\n    \"\"\"\n    potential_splits = {}\n    _, n_columns = df.shape\n    for column_index in range(n_columns - 1): # -1 to skip the target column\n        values = df.iloc[:, column_index]\n        unique_values = np.unique(values)\n        potential_splits[column_index] = [] # initialize a list for storing possible split values per column aka feature\n\n        # using mid-points between 2 consecutive unique values to split the data\n        for i in range(len(unique_values)-1):\n            split_value = (unique_values[i]+unique_values[i+1])/2\n            potential_splits[column_index].append(split_value)\n        \n    return potential_splits\n\n# let's see the potential splits for our data\npotential_splits = get_potential_splits(train_df)\nprint(\"Potential splits for each feature column:\")\nprint(potential_splits)\n\nPotential splits for each feature column:\n{0: [4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75, 4.85, 4.95, 5.05, 5.15, 5.25, 5.35, 5.45, 5.55, 5.65, 5.75, 5.85, 5.95, 6.05, 6.15, 6.25, 6.35, 6.45, 6.55, 6.65, 6.75, 6.85, 6.95, 7.05, 7.15, 7.25, 7.35, 7.550000000000001, 7.800000000000001], 1: [2.1, 2.25, 2.3499999999999996, 2.45, 2.55, 2.6500000000000004, 2.75, 2.8499999999999996, 2.95, 3.05, 3.1500000000000004, 3.25, 3.3499999999999996, 3.45, 3.55, 3.6500000000000004, 3.75, 3.8499999999999996, 3.95, 4.1, 4.300000000000001], 2: [1.1, 1.25, 1.35, 1.45, 1.55, 1.65, 1.7999999999999998, 2.45, 3.15, 3.4, 3.55, 3.6500000000000004, 3.75, 3.8499999999999996, 3.95, 4.05, 4.15, 4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75, 4.85, 4.95, 5.05, 5.15, 5.25, 5.35, 5.45, 5.55, 5.65, 5.75, 5.85, 5.95, 6.05, 6.199999999999999, 6.35, 6.550000000000001, 6.800000000000001], 3: [0.15000000000000002, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.8, 1.05, 1.15, 1.25, 1.35, 1.45, 1.55, 1.65, 1.75, 1.85, 1.95, 2.05, 2.1500000000000004, 2.25, 2.3499999999999996, 2.45]}\n\n\n0: above is first column i.e. sepal length (cms), 1: is second column and so on.\nNow, we have find all the possible ways to split the data (mentioned as (1))\nNow, let’s see how to get the best split by developing determine_best_split (mentioned as (2)). For this, First create a function that will split the data into 2 parts given column/ feature name and its value (2-1). Then, we will use this function to split the data for all possible combinations, calculate information gain and pick the one that gives highest information gain (2-2).\n\n# Function (2-1)\ndef split_data(df: pd.DataFrame, split_column: int, split_value: float) -&gt; tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]:\n    \"\"\" \n    SPlit the data into 2 subsets based on split column and split value.\n        split_column (int) : column index\n    \"\"\"\n    split_column_values = df.iloc[:, split_column]\n    left_split = df[split_column_values &lt;= split_value]\n    right_split = df[split_column_values &gt; split_value]\n\n    return left_split, right_split\n\n# Functions (2-2)\n\ndef determine_best_split(df: pd.DataFrame, potential_splits: dict) -&gt; tuple[int, float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the best split column and its value.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_split_column = None\n    best_split_value = None\n    best_info_gain = 0\n    parent_entropy = calculate_entropy(df) # Parent Entropy\n    \n    # (Recursive)Iterate over all possible combinations of columns and their split values\n    for column_index in potential_splits.keys():\n        for split_value in potential_splits[column_index]:\n            left_split, right_split = split_data(df, column_index, split_value)\n            average_children_entropy = calculate_average_children_entropy(left_split, right_split)\n            information_gain = parent_entropy - average_children_entropy\n            # print(\"Column:\", iris_data.feature_names[column_index], \"Split value:\", split_value, \"Information gain:\", information_gain)\n            \n            # pick the one with highest information gain\n            if information_gain &gt; best_info_gain:\n                best_info_gain = information_gain\n                best_split_column = column_index\n                best_split_value = split_value\n        \n    #print(\"Best Information Gain:\", best_info_gain)\n    return best_split_column, best_split_value\n\ndef calculate_average_children_entropy(left_split: pd.DataFrame, right_split: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the overall entropy of the data after splitting i.e. average entropy of the children nodes\n    overall entropy = weighted average of children entropies = Σ (p_c * E(c))\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(left_split) + len(right_split) # total size of data\n    w_left = len(left_split)/ n            # relative weight of left data\n    w_right = len(right_split)/ n          # relative weight of right data\n    overall_entropy = w_left * calculate_entropy(left_split) + w_right * calculate_entropy(right_split)\n    return overall_entropy\n\nAbove 2 functions should be straightforward to understand. Only new concept is: to get entropy of data after split - we calculate it as average weighted entropy of children nodes.\n(uncomment the print the statement in determine_best_split, if interested to see information gain for all possible splits)\n\nbest_split_column, best_split_value = determine_best_split(train_df, potential_splits)\nprint(\"Best split column:\", iris_data.feature_names[best_split_column], \"with value:\", best_split_value)\n\nBest split column: petal length (cm) with value: 2.45\n\n\nNote: The result one gets could be differnt if the seed/ random_state in train_val_split_df is changed (because it will change the underlying training data i.e. train_df)\nThe result I got: Best split column: petal length (cm) with value: 2.45\nNow, let’s create the splits\n\nleft_branch = train_df[train_df.iloc[:, best_split_column] &lt;= best_split_value] # branch that satisfies the condition: petal length (cm) &lt;= 2.45\nright_branch = train_df[train_df.iloc[:, best_split_column] &gt; best_split_value]\n\n# # or, we could also do\n# left_branch, right_branch = split_data(train_df, best_split_column, best_split_value)\n\nLet’s verify that after splitting the data has less impurity that is it has less entropy.\n(How do we do that? - By calculating weighted average entropy of children nodes)\n\nprint(f\"Before splitting,  Entropy: {parent_entropy}\")\nprint(f\"After splitting,  Entropy: {calculate_average_children_entropy(left_branch, right_branch)}\")\n\nBefore splitting,  Entropy: 1.5843670011535813\nAfter splitting,  Entropy: 0.6766708357927429\n\n\nSo, this verifies that our splitting was good.\nLet’s see if either of the child node (i.e. data split) is pure\n\ncheck_purity(left_branch), check_purity(right_branch)\n\n(True, False)\n\n\nWow! our left_branch is pure i.e. it contains all the datapoints that has single class. Thus, it would not need any further splitting.\nWhereas right_brach is not pure i.e. it contains datapoints from multiple classes. Thus, it would need further splitting.\n\nnp.unique(left_branch.target)\n\narray(['setosa'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\nnp.unique(right_branch.target, return_counts=True)\n\n(array(['versicolor', 'virginica'], dtype=object),\n array([43, 45], dtype=int64))\n\n\nBased on just one condition, we can create a small subtree as follows:\nsub_tree = {\"condition\" : [\"left_split_answer\", \"right_split_answer\"]}\n\n# In plain english (aka pythonic way)\nsub_tree = { \"petal length (cm) &lt;= 2.45\" : [\"setosa\", \"further splitting\"]}\n\nIf we suppose if this small sub-tree is our final decision tree which we want to use for testing. So, if we were to classify one test_example as input, we will check it’s petal length, see if it is less than &lt;= 2.45 cm, we will return setosa as the class, else, we will just randomly pick or pick the one with higher probability in the right_split as the predicted class.\nAlmost Never, we create decision tree with only a single condition i.e. 2 child nodes. Usually a decision tree is composed of multiple sub-trees composing multiple conditons.\nProgramatically speaking, we repeat the process of splitting for both the left_branch and right_branch until we reach the stopping condition:\n1. child nodes become pure\n2. a fixed number of steps\nNote: There should not be any doubt/confusion when I say that the condition for splitting a left_branch and right_branch belonging to same parent node could be completely different (because it depends upon the data distribution within the child node).\nLet’s build a full-fledged decision tree programatically using concepts of dynamic programming.\n\n1.

It also resulted in the perfect test accuracy\n\nControl the depth and min_samples in a decision tree\nIn the above case, we got test accuracy of 100%. But usually this is not the case because datasets are more complex.\nIf we allow the decision tree to grow unhibited manner then it overfits where it is possible that every leaf node would only have one data point. This is not a good decision tree because then prediction from such a tree becomes highly sensitive to small fluctuations in the data.\nHence, now we modify our code slightly to control this.\nRefer the notebooks in advanced section"
