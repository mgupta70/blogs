    "text": "In this notebook, we will be building a basic decision tree to learn and familiarize ourselves with various governing foundational concepts about decision trees. For this, we will use a relatively simple dataframe containing purely numerical features for the task of classification. As our understanding about decision trees expands, we will extend the concepts learned here to handle complex and challenging dataframes (such as those with missing values, with categorical features, etc.)\nLet’s load the popular iris data. (We are using sklearn only and only to load a popular benchmark dataset. We will not use it to build decision trees. Instead, we will build our decision trees entirely from scratch in using numpy)\n\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\n\n# load the data\niris_data = load_iris()\nX = iris_data.data\ny = iris_data.target\n\n# Here X and y are numpy arrays. We do a bit of processing to convert X and y into pandas dataframe for readability\nfeature_names = iris_data.feature_names\ntarget_names = iris_data.target_names\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names) # start df with features i.e. X\ndf['target'] = y                            # add target column to df i.e. y\n\ndf['target'] = df['target'].apply(lambda x: target_names[x]) # Optional: convert integer labels to actual class names\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\ntarget\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will build a decision tree which when given 4 numerical feature values will classify the plant species as one of 'setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'.\nFor this, we first need to split the data into train and val sets. Then we will use the train set to build the model and test it on the val set.\n\ndef train_test_split_df(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):\n    \"\"\" splits the data into train and test sets\"\"\"\n\n    if isinstance(test_size, float) and test_size&lt;1:\n        test_size = int(len(df)*test_size)\n    elif isinstance(test_size, int):\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"test size must be a float/ int\")\n    \n    shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(len(df))\n    test_indices = shuffled_indices[:test_size]\n    test_df = df.iloc[test_indices]\n    train_df = df.drop(test_indices)\n    return train_df, test_df\n\n\ntrain_df, test_df = train_test_split_df(df, test_size=20, random_state=0)\nprint(f'Train size: {len(train_df)}, Test size: {len(test_df)}')\ntrain_df.head()\n\nTrain size: 130, Test size: 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\ntarget\n\n\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build a decision tree, the dataset is split into 2 subsets using a condition - where one subset satisfies the condition and another does not.\nThe condition is nothing but thresholding of one the features. (For example, condition: sepal lenghth &lt;= 4.4 cms will split the dataset into 2 subsets - one where sepal lenghth is less than 4.4 cms and another where it is not)\nThe main question here is how we decide which feature to use and what threshold to pick?\nAnswer: Pick the feature which results in most information gain.\nNow to understand the above term information gain, we need to first familiarize ourselves with few more concepts.\n\nPurity - Measure of homogenity of a subset. For ex: if a data subset contains only red balls - it is pure. But if it contains even a single green ball - it is now impure. The extent of impurity is measured using entropy.\nEntropy - calculated as:\n  H(X) = — Σ (pi * log2 pi)\n\nwhere; X = Total number of samples, and, pi is the probability of class i\nPure dataset: - One which contains elements belonging to single class. For e.g.: All red balls - For a pure dataset: entropy = 0\nMost Impure dataset: - One which contains elements distributed equally among other classes. For e.g.: 10 blue balls and 10 red balls - For the most impure subset: entropy = 1\n\nInformation Gain - If we split the dataset, then the entropy (i.e. degree of impurity) in the children subsets should ideally be lower. This reduction in entropy is the information gain.\n Information Gain = entropy (parent) — [average entropy of ( children)]\n\nNow, based on the above concepts, we will split the dataset, using the feature that results in highest information gain.\nAnd how we do this?\nAnswer: Brute Force. Yes, Brute Force… We go through all the feature columns one at a time and for each feature column, we go through all of their possible values one at a time, splitting the data into 2 children nodes, calculating information gain, storing it and then pick one which gave us the highest information gain.\nWe repeat this process, either a fixed number of times or until the entropy of children becomes zero (i.e. children subsets become pure) and then we stop.\nLet’s see this step by step…\n\n# let's check the purity of our current data\n\ndef check_purity(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if data is pure.\n    \"\"\"\n    y = df.iloc[:, -1]\n    return len(y.unique())==1\n\nprint('Is the train data pure? -&gt;', check_purity(train_df))\n\nIs the train data pure? -&gt; False\n\n\nAs it is not pure. Let’s see how much impure it is by calculating entropy.\n\ndef calculate_entropy(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the entropy of the data. Entropy =  — Σ (pi * log2 pi)\n    \"\"\"\n    y = df.iloc[:, -1]\n    values, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)\n    probs = counts/len(y)\n    entropy = -np.sum(probs*np.log2(probs))\n    return entropy\n\nparent_entropy = calculate_entropy(train_df)\nprint(f\"Entropy of parent node: {parent_entropy}\")\n\nEntropy of parent node: 1.5848773505329046\n\n\nNow, let’s see the details of how we will split the data. The code below should be very straightforward and intuitive to understand.\nAs mentioned, now (1) we will go through all features and their all possible values to split the dataset and then (2)check the information gain. SO, let’s first create the function called get_potential_splits that does (1) for us and then we will implement determine_best_split that will do (2) for us.\n\n# Function (1)\ndef get_potential_splits(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Get all the possible potential splits of the data.\n    \"\"\"\n    potential_splits = {}\n    _, n_columns = df.shape\n    for column_index in range(n_columns - 1): # -1 to skip the target column\n        values = df.iloc[:, column_index]\n        unique_values = np.unique(values)\n        potential_splits[column_index] = [] # initialize a list for storing possible split values per column aka feature\n\n        # using mid-points between 2 consecutive unique values to split the data\n        for i in range(len(unique_values)-1):\n            split_value = (unique_values[i]+unique_values[i+1])/2\n            potential_splits[column_index].append(split_value)\n        \n    return potential_splits\n\n# let's see the potential splits for our data\npotential_splits = get_potential_splits(train_df)\nprint(\"Potential splits for each feature column:\")\nprint(potential_splits)\n\nPotential splits for each feature column:\n{0: [4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75, 4.85, 4.95, 5.05, 5.15, 5.25, 5.35, 5.45, 5.55, 5.65, 5.75, 5.85, 5.95, 6.05, 6.15, 6.25, 6.35, 6.45, 6.55, 6.65, 6.75, 6.85, 7.0, 7.15, 7.25, 7.35, 7.5, 7.65], 1: [2.1, 2.25, 2.3499999999999996, 2.45, 2.55, 2.6500000000000004, 2.75, 2.8499999999999996, 2.95, 3.05, 3.1500000000000004, 3.25, 3.3499999999999996, 3.45, 3.55, 3.6500000000000004, 3.75, 3.8499999999999996, 4.0, 4.15], 2: [1.05, 1.2000000000000002, 1.35, 1.45, 1.55, 1.65, 1.7999999999999998, 2.45, 3.15, 3.4, 3.55, 3.6500000000000004, 3.75, 3.8499999999999996, 3.95, 4.05, 4.15, 4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75, 4.85, 4.95, 5.05, 5.15, 5.25, 5.35, 5.45, 5.55, 5.65, 5.75, 5.85, 5.95, 6.05, 6.199999999999999, 6.449999999999999, 6.65, 6.800000000000001], 3: [0.15000000000000002, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.8, 1.05, 1.15, 1.25, 1.35, 1.45, 1.55, 1.65, 1.75, 1.85, 1.95, 2.05, 2.1500000000000004, 2.25, 2.3499999999999996, 2.45]}\n\n\n0: above is first column i.e. sepal length (cms), 1: is second column and so on.\nNow, we have find all the possible ways to split the data (mentioned as (1))\nNow, let’s see how to get the best split by developing determine_best_split (mentioned as (2)). For this, first create a function (2-1) that will split the data into 2 parts given a feature and its value. Then, we will use this function to split the data for all possible combinations, calculate information gain and pick the one that gives highest information gain (2-2).\n\n# Function (2-1)\ndef split_data(df: pd.DataFrame, split_column: int, split_value: float) -&gt; tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]:\n    \"\"\" \n    SPlit the data into 2 subsets based on split column and split value.\n        split_column (int) : column index\n    \"\"\"\n    split_column_values = df.iloc[:, split_column]\n    left_split = df[split_column_values &lt;= split_value]\n    right_split = df[split_column_values &gt; split_value]\n\n    return left_split, right_split\n\n# Functions (2-2)\ndef determine_best_split(df: pd.DataFrame, potential_splits: dict) -&gt; tuple[int, float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the best split column and its value.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_split_column = None\n    best_split_value = None\n    best_info_gain = 0\n    parent_entropy = calculate_entropy(df) # Parent Entropy\n    \n    # (Recursive)Iterate over all possible combinations of columns and their split values\n    for column_index in potential_splits.keys():\n        for split_value in potential_splits[column_index]:\n            left_split, right_split = split_data(df, column_index, split_value)\n            average_children_entropy = calculate_average_children_entropy(left_split, right_split)\n            information_gain = parent_entropy - average_children_entropy\n            # print(\"Column:\", iris_data.feature_names[column_index], \"Split value:\", split_value, \"Information gain:\", information_gain)\n            \n            # pick the one with highest information gain\n            if information_gain &gt; best_info_gain:\n                best_info_gain = information_gain\n                best_split_column = column_index\n                best_split_value = split_value\n        \n    #print(\"Best Information Gain:\", best_info_gain)\n    return best_split_column, best_split_value\n\ndef calculate_average_children_entropy(left_split: pd.DataFrame, right_split: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the overall entropy of the data after splitting i.e. average entropy of the children nodes\n    overall entropy = weighted average of children entropies = Σ (p_c * E(c))\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(left_split) + len(right_split) # total size of data\n    w_left = len(left_split)/ n            # relative weight of left data\n    w_right = len(right_split)/ n          # relative weight of right data\n    overall_entropy = w_left * calculate_entropy(left_split) + w_right * calculate_entropy(right_split)\n    return overall_entropy\n\nAbove 2 functions should be straightforward to understand. Only new concept is: to get entropy of data after split - we calculate it as average weighted entropy of children nodes.\n(uncomment the print the statement in determine_best_split, if interested to see information gain for all possible splits)\n\nbest_split_column, best_split_value = determine_best_split(train_df, potential_splits)\nprint(\"Best split column:\", iris_data.feature_names[best_split_column], \"with value:\", best_split_value)\n\nBest split column: petal length (cm) with value: 2.45\n\n\nNote: The result one gets could be different if the seed/ random_state in train_val_split_df is changed (because it will change the underlying training data i.e. train_df)\nThe result I got: Best split column: petal length (cm) with value: 2.45\nNow, let’s create the splits\n\nleft_branch = train_df[train_df.iloc[:, best_split_column] &lt;= best_split_value] # branch that satisfies the condition: petal length (cm) &lt;= 2.45\nright_branch = train_df[train_df.iloc[:, best_split_column] &gt; best_split_value]\n\n# # or, we could also do\n# left_branch, right_branch = split_data(train_df, best_split_column, best_split_value)\n\nLet’s verify that after splitting the data has less impurity that is it has less entropy.\n(How do we do that? - By calculating weighted average entropy of children nodes)\n\nprint(f\"Before splitting,  Entropy: {parent_entropy}\")\nprint(f\"After splitting,  Entropy: {calculate_average_children_entropy(left_branch, right_branch)}\")\n\nBefore splitting,  Entropy: 1.5848773505329046\nAfter splitting,  Entropy: 0.6691669882046775\n\n\nSo, this verifies that our splitting was good.\nLet’s see if either of the child node (i.e. data split) is pure\n\ncheck_purity(left_branch), check_purity(right_branch)\n\n(True, False)\n\n\nWow! our left_branch is pure i.e. it contains all the datapoints that has single class. Thus, it would not need any further splitting.\nWhereas right_brach is not pure i.e. it contains datapoints from multiple classes. Thus, it would need further splitting.\n\nnp.unique(left_branch.target) # see classes in left_branch\n\narray(['setosa'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\nnp.unique(right_branch.target, return_counts=True)  # see classes in right_branch\n\n(array(['versicolor', 'virginica'], dtype=object),\n array([43, 44], dtype=int64))\n\n\nBased on just one condition, we can create a small subtree as follows:\nsub_tree = {\"condition\" : [\"left_split_answer\", \"right_split_answer\"]}\nIf we suppose if this small sub-tree is our final decision tree which we want to use for testing. So, if we were to classify one test_example as input, we will check it’s petal length, see if it is less than &lt;= 2.45 cm, we will return setosa as the class, else, we will pick the class with higher relative probability in the right_branch as the predicted class.\n\n# In plain english \nsub_tree = { \"petal length (cm) &lt;= 2.45\" : [\"setosa\", \"versicolor\"]} # right split is versicolor because it is dominant in right_branch\n\nAlmost Never, we create decision tree with only a single condition i.e. 2 child nodes. Usually a decision tree is composed of multiple sub-trees composing multiple conditons.\nProgramatically speaking, we repeat the process of splitting for both the left_branch and right_branch until we reach the stopping condition:\n\nchild nodes become pure\na fixed number of steps by setting hyperparameters like max_depth, min_samples, etc.\n\nNote: There should not be any doubt/confusion when I say that the condition for splitting a left_branch and right_branch belonging to same parent node could be completely different (because it depends upon the data distribution within the child node).\nLet’s build a full-fledged decision tree programatically using concepts of dynamic programming.\n\nDecision Tree code (for case 1. i.e keep splitting until child nodes become pure)N\n(Note: FYI: Case 2. i.e. splitting fo a fixed number of steps is also covered later in this notebook.)\n\ndef decision_tree_algorithm(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; dict:\n    data = df\n\n    # base case: If data is pure-&gt; stop and return the class of the child node\n    if check_purity(data):\n        predicted_class = np.unique(data.iloc[:, -1])[0] # only 1 unique value\n        return predicted_class\n    \n    # else: keep on splitting \n    # Recursive\n    else:\n        # for splitting: get_potential_splits -&gt; determine_best_split -&gt; split_data based on best_split_column and best_split_value\n        potential_splits = get_potential_splits(data)\n        best_split_column, best_split_value = determine_best_split(data, potential_splits)\n        left_branch, right_branch = split_data(data, best_split_column, best_split_value)\n\n        \n        condition = \"{} &lt;= {}\".format(list(df.columns)[best_split_column], best_split_value)\n        # create the sub-tree as a dictionary storing the condition as key and a list as the value.

This is not a good decision tree because then prediction from such a tree becomes highly sensitive to small fluctuations in the data.\nHence, now we modify our code to pre-prune the tree i.e. limit its growth using max_depth and min_samples as the hyperparamters\n\n\n\nDecision Tree code (for case 2. i.e. splitting fo a fixed number of steps)\nBefore we write the actual code, we need a function to get the majority class label of the set if the subset is not pure but further splitting is not possible because stopping condition is reached.\n\ndef get_majority_class(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Classify the data.\n    \"\"\"\n    y = df.iloc[:, -1]\n    return y.mode()[0]\n\n\ndef decision_tree_improved(df: pd.DataFrame, counter = 0,  min_samples=2, max_depth=5) -&gt; dict:\n\n    data = df\n    # base case: If data is pure or we hit max_depth or min_sample condition violates-&gt; stop and return the class of the child node\n    if check_purity(data) or (len(data) &lt; min_samples) or (counter == max_depth):\n        predicted_class = get_majority_class(data) \n        return predicted_class\n    \n    # else: keep on splitting \n    # Recursive\n    else:\n        counter+=1\n        # for splitting: get_potential_splits -&gt; determine_best_split -&gt; split_data based on best_split_column and best_split_value\n        potential_splits = get_potential_splits(data)\n        best_split_column, best_split_value = determine_best_split(data, potential_splits)\n        left_branch, right_branch = split_data(data, best_split_column, best_split_value)\n\n        \n        condition = \"{} &lt;= {}\".format(list(data.columns)[best_split_column], best_split_value)\n        # create the sub-tree as a dictionary storing the condition as key and a list as the value.

    "text": "In this notebook, we will be building a Linear Regression model from scratch to learn and familiarize ourselves with various governing foundational concepts about it. For this, we will use a sklearn.datasets.make_regression function to create a simple synthetic dataset in one variable. We can extend the concepts learned here to build multi-variate linear regression models.\n\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\n\n# Generate the data\nX,y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=7, random_state=42) \n# Here, \n# X.shape: (n_samples, n_features) = (100, 1)\n# y.shape: (n_samples, ) = (100, )\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,3))\nax.scatter(X,y)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that X axis varies from -2 to 2. It implies that our feature space is already normalized.😄\nHowever, if we are dealing with multiple features, then it is common to have different features in different range. For ex. in a dataset of house price prediction, the house area can range from 100-5000 while number of bedrooms typically range from 1-5. To make the linear regression model to give equal importance to all the features, it is a good practise to bring all the features in same range. So, we normalize the features. There are multiple ways to normalize:\n\nX/max: new feature range is 0 to 1\nX-mean/std: new feature range is -3 to 3 mostly (except outliers)\n(X-min)/(max-min): new feature range is 0 to 1\n\nIn Machine Learning, whenever, we want to build any model, we usually split it into 2 sets - train and val. We build algo on train and finetune its hyperparameters to optimise the loss/error function on val set. This step is mandatory. So, let’s build a helper function\n\ndef train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):\n    \"\"\" splits the data into train and test sets\"\"\"\n\n    np.random.seed(random_state)\n    n = X.shape[0]\n\n    if isinstance(test_size, float) and test_size&lt;1:\n        test_size = int(n*test_size)\n    elif isinstance(test_size, int):\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"test size must be a float/ int\")\n    \n    shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(n)\n    test_indices = shuffled_indices[:test_size]\n    train_indices = shuffled_indices[test_size:]\n    X_train = X[train_indices]\n    X_test = X[test_indices]\n    y_train = y[train_indices]\n    y_test = y[test_indices]\n    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test\n\n\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=20, random_state=0)\nprint(f'Train size: {X_train.shape[0]}, Test size: {X_val.shape[0]}')\n\n# plot the train and val data to see the split\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,3))\nax.scatter(X_train,y_train, c='blue', label='train')\nax.scatter(X_val,y_val, c='red', label='val')\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nTrain size: 80, Test size: 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the question is how do we decide the size of val set and how we should create it?\nAnswer: There is no strict metric on how to decide the size of val set. The most important aspect to consider while creating val set is - it should be a representative of train set. This means, the points in the val set should have a good spread throughout the training data. What does this mean ? - Suppose, all val points (red) occur together and not separated from one another, then it is not a good split. Because this val data does not capture the distribution of train data and since the ultimate use of val data is to optimize the model, then it means we will end up optimizing the model only for a short spread of the data and not the entirety of it. Hence, we mostly perform random sampling to make sure that we get different and spread-out points in the hope that they would be a representative set of the entire training data. To achieve this, we can choose 20% of the data or 30% or 5% depending upon the distrubution of the data we are dealing with. Typical value is 15-25% sampled randomly. (But both the val data percentage and sampling method will vary depending upon the nature of the problem. Read more here )\nAfter creating the splits of train and val data, we can now write code to build a regression model.\n(FYI, if normalization of features is required as mentioned above, then normalization is performed after the data splitting. Various normalization constants are calculated from the train split of the data and stored for processing val and real test data that comes during the production stage.)\nWe are now writing a code for a simplistic model: yhat = wx + b\nwhere w and b are randomly initialized and\noptimized by Gradient Descent\nIn Linear regression, we use mean square error as loss function for optimiztion via Gradient Descent\n\n# hyperparameter\nlr = 0.001\nepochs = 101\n\n# initialize weights and biases randomly\nw = np.random.rand()\nb = np.random.rand()\n\n# Gradient Descent \ntrain_losses = []\nval_losses = []\nfor epoch in range(epochs):\n    # Go through TRAIN data\n    yhat = w*X_train + b\n    yhat = np.squeeze(yhat)\n    # mean square error loss\n    mse_loss = np.mean((y_train-yhat)**2)\n    if (epoch)%20==0:\n        print(f\"EPOCH: {epoch}, Train LOSS:{round(mse_loss, 3)}\")\n    train_losses.append(mse_loss)\n    # step of Gradient Descent\n    w = w - lr*(yhat-y_train)@X_train\n    x0 = np.ones((X_train.shape[0],1))\n    b = b - lr*(yhat-y_train)@x0 # or : b = b - lr * np.sum(yhat - y_train)\n    ## Monitor performance on VAL data\n    yhat = w*X_val + b\n    yhat = np.squeeze(yhat)\n    mse_loss = np.mean((y_val-yhat)**2)\n    if (epoch)%20==0:\n        print(f\"EPOCH: {epoch}, Val LOSS:{round(mse_loss, 3)}\")\n    val_losses.append(mse_loss)\n\nEPOCH: 0, Train LOSS:1567.608\nEPOCH: 0, Val LOSS:1552.406\nEPOCH: 20, Train LOSS:145.819\nEPOCH: 20, Val LOSS:168.799\nEPOCH: 40, Train LOSS:40.83\nEPOCH: 40, Val LOSS:73.231\nEPOCH: 60, Train LOSS:31.699\nEPOCH: 60, Val LOSS:68.759\nEPOCH: 80, Train LOSS:30.857\nEPOCH: 80, Val LOSS:69.459\nEPOCH: 100, Train LOSS:30.777\nEPOCH: 100, Val LOSS:69.843\n\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,3))\nax.plot(range(epochs),train_losses, c=\"b\", label = 'train loss')\nax.plot(range(epochs),val_losses, c=\"red\", label = 'val loss')\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually, you should see decreasing error/loss values. If this does not happen, few things need to be checked: 1. Reduce learning rate, lr and retry 2. Always, check if the shapes of variables are correct. For ex: bias, b shape must be (1,); w: (1, ), mse_loss: (1,), yhat: (num_samples in train/val, ) and so on. I have seen many times, while working with numpy, if you are not careful of matrix multiplication and dot product rules, the shapes of your variables become incorrect causing weird model training. You could also see an up and down behaviour in train loss. For example: If you miss to account for x0 while calculating bias b -&gt; it will cause massive shape issues throughout.\nAnyhow, for our case, we did not encounter any such strange behavior. Let’s see the model we trained:\n\nprint(f\"Linear Regression Model: wx+b = {w}*x+{b}\")\n\nLinear Regression Model: wx+b = [44.0082033]*x+[0.38012626]\n\n\n\nxmin = min(X); yhat_min  = w*xmin+b\nxmax = max(X); yhat_max  = w*xmax+b\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,3))\nax.scatter(X,y, label = 'data')\nax.plot([xmin, xmax], [yhat_min, yhat_max], c=\"red\", label='fitted model')\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trained model fits really well visually. But how do we quantify the quality of fit?\nAnswer: r2-score\nI often used to forget the formula for r2-score, until I understood the reasoning behind it and then, I no longer needed to memorize it. I could reproduce the formula within seconds by following pure logic. In fact, I feel this is the best way to also sharpen your data understanding skills. Being able to reason about the data stuff and write it in terms of maths - this is the skill that will make you a data scientist with sharp eyes and mind.\n\nr2-score forumla\nLet’s understand the r2-score and derive its formula by asking just basic questions i.e. first principle thinking.\nQ. What is the simplest model we could use without any fancy math?\nA. use mean i.e. the average as the answer, yhat for any given x\nQ. Now, if we use the simplest model, what is the sum of squares of error?\nA. np.sum((y-mean)**2)\nQ. What is the sum of squares of error from our model?\nA. np.sum((y-yhat)**2)\nQ. If we have trained a good model, it should be better than baseline (simplest model, where we predict average no matter what X is). That is, sum of squares of error from trained model &lt; sum of squares of error from simplest model. But how much better?\nA. 1 - np.sum((y-yhat)^2) /np.sum((y-mean)^2)\n\n# simplest model \nymean = np.mean(y_train) # use train to calculate the model, where model = mean\nSST = np.sum((y_val - ymean)**2) # calculte sum of square of error on val data\nprint('SST: ', SST)\n\n# trained model\nyhat = w*X_val + b\nyhat = np.squeeze(yhat)\nRSS = np.sum((y_val-yhat)**2)\nprint('RSS: ', RSS)\n\n# R2-score\nr2_score = 1-RSS/SST\nprint('r2_score: ', r2_score)\n\nSST:  37726.247861497875\nRSS:  1396.867522387115\nr2_score:  0.9629735899653908\n\n\nFor simplest model,\nmodel = ymean, sum of square of error is called SST = Total sum of squares\nFor trained model,\nmodel = wx+b, sum of square of error is called RSS = Sum of square of Residuals\nr2_score close to 1 means the model explains the data well.\nr2_score ranges from 0 to 1. Can you think what what does r² = 0 mean?"
