    "text": "YOLO V1\nOfficial Paper\n\nA. Labeling the data:\nIn YOLO v1 the grid size is 7 x 7.\n\nA grid cell is labeled to contain an object only if the center of the bounding box is in it. If the grid cell contains a center, the “objectness” is labeled 1 and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nB. Predictions:\nFor 1 grid cell we predict: 5B + C paramters\nFor whole image divided into S x S grids, we predict: S X S X (5B + C) params\nwhere,\n5: 4 bbox values (x,y,w,h) + 1 (confidence score) : (Formally, confidence = Probab(Object) x IOU(truth,pred). If no object exists in a cell, the confidence scores should be zero. Otherwise confidence score will be equal to the IOU b/w predicted box and the ground truth.)\nB: number of bboxes predicted per grid cell, B=2 (author’s choice) (B is not related to the number of classes.)\nC: number of classes (class probabilities) : (conditional class probabilities, Pr(class_i|Object))\n\nIf we call P(object) the probability there is an object in a box b and P(c|object) the probability that the object is of class c, then the score for the class c in the box b in simply\n\\(P(c) = P(c|\\text{object})\\times P(\\text{object})\\)\n\n\nArchitecture\nFine-details: 1. To improve the speed of the network, they alternated convolutional layers with 3x3 kernel size and convolutional layers with 1x1 kernel size. How?\nAns:\nLet’s, we have a feature map of size 56 x 56 x 192 and we want to apply a convolution layer of 256 filters of kernel size 3 x 3. For each filter, we have:\n\\(56 \\times 56 \\times 192 \\times 3 \\times 3 =  5,419,008 \\text{ computations}\\)\nFor all the filters we have:\n\\(5,419,008 \\times 256 = \\sim 1.4 \\text{B computations}\\)\nvs\nlet’s apply a convolution layer of 128 filters of kernel size 1 x 1 first:\n\\(56 \\times 56 \\times 192 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 128 =  77,070,336 \\text{ computations}\\)\nand the resulting feature map is of size 56 x 56 x 128. Now, let’s apply our convolution layer of 256 filters with kernel size 3 x 3\n\\(56 \\times 56 \\times 128 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 256=  924,844,032 \\text{ computations}\\)\nAdding 77,070,336 +924,844,032=1\nTherefore applying a 1 x 1 convolution prior to the 3 x 3 convolution reduces the dimensionality of the tensors and saves ~ 0.4B computations.\n\nThe architecture uses Conv, Maxpool and Linear layers such that at the end the output should be 7x7x30. This was done because image was divided into 7x7 grids and for each grid, we are predicting 20 class probabs and 2 bboxes containing 5 values each (4 xywh + 1 conf). This was a customized setting applicable for PASCAL VOC dataset that had 20 classes. (Actualy the last layer is a FC layer not COnv layer. nn.Linear (4096, 7*7*30))\n\n\nTraining\nFor each image we prepare ground truth as 7x7x30 tensor as explained in the start. Model also outputs 7x7x30 tensor then, using the loss explained below the model was trained.\n\n\nLoss\nMean squared error loss for everything!!!\n\nLet’s break loss line by line\n\nThe identity function is 0 when there is no object or the current bounding box isn’t the responsible one. In other words, we only calculate the loss for the best bounding box. So the first line of the equation is the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual midpoints of the objects in all grid cells which have an object in them and are the responsible bounding box.\nThe second line is the sum of the squared differences between the square roots of the predicted and actual widths and heights in all grid cells which have an object in them. These are square rooted for reasons explained earlier.\nThe third line is just the squared difference between the predicted class probabilities and the actual class probabilities in all cells which have an object.\nThe fourth line is the same but for all cells which don’t have an object in them.\nThe reason these two (3rd and 4th lines) are split up is so that we can multiply the fourth line by the noobj coefficient to punish the model less severely if it misclassifies when there is no object present.\nQ: Why square root used for bbox size loss and not normal dimension?\nA: Because it gives different weights to bboxes of different sizes. We want to make this error larger for smaller bboxes\nLet’s understand by example.\nCase-1 : Actual width = 100, Predicted width = 98\nCase-2 : Actual width = 4, Predicted width = 2\nIn both the case the deviation is same i.e. 2 but the quality of bbox for small bbox (Case-2) is very poor while quality of BBox predicted in Case-1 is really good.\nLoss with normal width\nCase-1 Loss: (100-98)**2 = 4\nCase-2 Loss: (4-2)**2 = 4\nLoss with square-root width\nCase-1 Loss: (10-9.899)**2 = 0.01\nCase-2 Loss: (2-1.414)**2 = 0.343\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNMS\n\nFind all the boxes with a high objectness score. This is the level of confidence of the model that there is an object in the grid cell. We typically have a confidence threshold, so any box with a lower score is not considered.\n\n\n\nWe then choose the box with the high confidence scores and remove the boxes that have high overlap i.e. IoU with the the highest confidence bbox. (Overlap is decided by IOU IoU)\n\n\nExact Algo\nSuppose we have B: bboxes preds, C_thresh: confidence thresh (objectness score) for each bbox\niou_thresh: iou overlap threshold\n\nFilter bboxes with confidence &gt; C_thresh. Suppose now B -&gt; B_new\nSort bboxes in B_new by confidence scores in descending order\nInitialize a new variable F_bboxes to store final bboxes\nwhile B_new is not empty:\n4.1 for b1 bbox in B_new\n4.2 Add b1 to F_bboxes\n4.3 Remove b1 from B_new\n4.4 for remaining b2 in B_new:\n4.4.1 if IoU(b1, b2) &gt;= iou_thresh -&gt; remove b2 from B_new\n\n# Suppose B contains BBoxes as list of list of 5 coordinates (x,y,w,h,c) : where c is confidence (objectness score)\n\nB = sorted(B, key=lambda x: x[4], reverse=True) # initial_bboxes\nF = [] # final_bboxes\n\nwhile len(B)!=0:\n    b1 = B.pop(0)\n    F.append(b1)\n\n    remaining_bboxes = []\n    for b2 in B:\n        if iou(b1, b2) &lt; iou_thresh:\n            remaining_bboxes.append(b2)\n    B = b2\n\n\n\nProblems:\n1.1 Did not account for this Edge case: In the case the grid cell contains 2 objects, suppose cat and a dog, we need to choose one of the classes as the label for the training data.\n1.2 YOLO can only predict a limited number of bounding boxes per grid cell, 2 in the original research paper. And though that number can be increased, only one class prediction can be made per cell, limiting the detections when multiple objects appear in a single grid cell. Thus, it struggles with bounding groups of small objects, such as flocks of birds, or multiple small objects of different classes.\n\nYOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding box predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes and can only have one class. This spatial constraint limits the number of nearby objects that our model can predict.\nThe model struggled with small objects that appear in groups, such as flocks of birds\nTHeir loss function treats errors the same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding boxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a small error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU\nDetections at multi-scale not supported."

This helps to improve the detection performance of small objects.\nIn YOLOv2 (and beyond), instead of predicting arbitrary bounding boxes directly, the model predicts offsets from a fixed set of predefined boxes, called anchor boxes or prior boxes.\nThe different classes are this time passed through a Softmax activation function and the loss function is using cross-entropy instead of MSE.\nGrid size = 13x13 to ensure better detection of smaller objects\n\n\nAnchor Boxes\nAnchor Boxes: Sort of priors about object shapes; they guide the model in doing better predictions.\nInstead of directly predicting the x & y i.e. bbox centers, the model predicts tx and ty such that:\n\\(x = \\sigma(t_x)\\)\n\\(y = \\sigma(t_y)\\)\nwhere, \\(\\sigma\\) is sigmoid: \\(\\sigma(a) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp - a}\\)\nTo get width bw and bh for the bbox, the model predicts tw and th such that\n\\(b_w = p_w e^{t_w}\\)\n\\(b_h = p_h e^{t_h}\\)\nwhere, \\(p_w\\) and \\(p_h\\) are already known when we calculated anchor boxes (explained later).\n\nThe model predicts to (objectness score) also such that:\n\\(P(\\text{object})= \\sigma(t_o)\\)\nQ: Why \\(\\sigma\\)?\nA: Makes x and y bounded between 0 and 1 -&gt; center is always within the cell\n\nHow to calculate anchor boxes?\nK-means algorithm with K=5 (i.e. compute 5 anchors) over the trainig data, clustering together similar shapes.\nSteps:\n\nThey ran K-Means clustering on the bounding boxes in the training set.\nEach bounding box is treated as a 2D point: [w,h]\nTraditional K-Means uses Euclidean distance, but that doesn’t work well for boxes (e.g., a tall-skinny box and short-wide box can have the same area and Euclidean norm but behave very differently).\nInstead, they used a custom distance function:\n\nd=1−IoU(box, cluster center)\nSo two boxes are close if their IoU is high.\n\nAfter clustering:\n5.1 They used the average width and height of each cluster to define an anchor box.\n5.2 They selected K = 5, meaning each grid cell has 5 anchor boxes it can predict from.\nModel Output:\n\nFor each anchor box, YOLOv2 predicts:\n[tx, ty, tw, th, to] Where:\ntx,ty : offsets from the cell\ntw ,th: log-scale offset from anchor box dimensions\nto: objectness score\nNOTES:\n\nNormalize bounding box widths and heights to [0, 1] before clustering.\n\n\n\nWhy is this better than YOLOv1?\nAns: YOLOv1 predicted 2 arbitrary boxes per grid cell, regardless of dataset statistics.\nYOLOv2 learns K well-distributed, representative shapes — making the model better at fitting real-world object shapes.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\nVariant of vgg\nDarkNet-19: Similar to Yolov1, but had BatchNorm for regularization, replaced last linear layer with conv layer"

    "text": "In this notebook, we will understand and build Hash Table aka Dictionary in Python from scratch. We will build it step-by-step after understanding its core concepts.\n\n# type hints\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\nQ. Why do we need Dictionary or a Hash map? Why not simply use array?\nAnswer: 2 reasons\n\nSearching in array has O(n) time-complexity whereas searching in dictionary has a constant O(1) time-complexity.\n\n\n\nAnother reason for using Hash table/ Hash map is that it make its use more intuitive. For example: in dictionary to find price on march 6, simply write stock_prices['march 6'] whereas, if we are using array, we need to write a for loop as shown above. It makes the code complex, inefficient and not super-intuitive to write.\n\n\nHash function\nIn Hash Table, we use a Hash Function - which converts a string key into a index value (integer).\nFor example: march 6 is converted to 9 by using sum of its ascii values and its mod with 10 as the hash function (assuming we are making a dictionary contaning only 10 elements). In Python, we can get ascii value of a character by using ord\n\nLet’s write a code to do this i.e. convert a string key into an index\n\ndef get_hash(key):\n    total = 0\n    for char in key:\n        total+=ord(char)\n    return total%10 # assuming 10 is the size of array\n\nprint('march 6: hashes into the index value = ', get_hash('march 6'))\n\nmarch 6: hashes into the index value =  9\n\n\nGreat! it works. Now, we can try writing the code for HashTable class.\n\n\nHashTable\nBefore diving into the code, it’s a good idea to pause for a moment and think what different methods/functionalities we want our HashTableto support. Once we have a clear understanding of these requirements, writing the code becomes much simpler.\nThroughout this blog, I will include visual diagrams to help illustrate what we’re aiming to build with the HashTable. These images will serve as mental maps, making it easier to write and understand the code. (Being able to visualize how data structures work is key to mastering them. Once you can visualize them, you’ll be able to code them effortlessly—without memorizing a single line.)\nQ. What functions we want in HashTable?\nAnswer: \n\nWe want to add a key-value pair\nWe want to get value by supplying key\nWe want to remove by supplying key\n\nTo implement any of the above functionalities, we’ll first need a way to hash a key into an integer index—since computers operate on numbers, not strings. (Technically, computers can handle strings, but only by converting them to numerical codes, which is abstracted away from us.)\nOnce we have this index, we’ll use it to internally manipulate data in the array to achieve the desired functionality.\nBased on the information presented above, the simplest signature of HashTable would look like this:\nclass HashTable:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def get_hash(self, key: str):\n        \"\"\" converts a key into index (int) \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def add(self, key: str, value: Union[str, int]):\n        \"\"\" adds a key-value pair \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def get(self, key: str):\n        \"\"\" outputs value given a key \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def remove(self, key:str):\n        \"\"\" removes key-value given a key \"\"\"\n        pass\nLet’s start coding it.\nWe will try to test it for a simple case illustrated below:\n\n\nclass HashTable:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.MAX = 10 # assume 10 is the size of dictionary\n        self.arr = [None for i in range(self.MAX)] # allocate memory\n\n    def get_hash(self, key: str):\n        \"\"\" converts a key into index (int) \"\"\"\n        total = 0\n        for char in key:\n            total+=ord(char)\n        return total%self.MAX\n\n    def add(self, key: str, value: Union[str, int]):\n        \"\"\" adds a key-value pair \"\"\"\n        idx = self.get_hash(key) # get the index for a key\n        self.arr[idx] = value    # insert value at the calculated index\n\n    def get(self, key: str):\n        \"\"\" outputs value given a key \"\"\"\n        idx = self.get_hash(key) # get the index for a key\n        return self.arr[idx]     # return the value at the calculated index\n\n    def remove(self, key:str):\n        \"\"\" removes value given a key \"\"\"\n        idx = self.get_hash(key) # get the index for a key\n        self.arr[idx] = None     # set the value to None at the calculated index\n\n\n# Let's test the code we created so far \nht = HashTable()\nprint('array on initialization', ht.arr)\n# add values\nht.add('march 6', 310)\nht.add('march 7', 340)\nht.add('march 8', 380)\nprint('after adding data', ht.arr)\n# get value\nprint('value on march 6 is: ', ht.get('march 6'))\n# remove value\nht.remove('march 8')\nprint('after removal: value on march 8 is: ', ht.get('march 8'))\n\narray on initialization [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]\nafter adding data [340, 380, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 310]\nvalue on march 6 is:  310\nafter removal: value on march 8 is:  None\n\n\nGreat! this works as expected! Now let’s do testing on edge cases.\n\n# Edge case-1: get value for a non-existent key\nprint('value on march 17 is: ', ht.get('march 17'))\n\nvalue on march 17 is:  310\n\n\nOops!\nWhy are we getting the value for a non-existent key like march 17 to be the same as the value for march 6?\nAnswer: This happened because both march 17 and march 6 produced the same index - 9 - when passed through our get_hash function. And, since our get method relies solely on this index and ddoesn’t verify whether the actual string key exists at that index, it ends up returning an incorrect value.\nNote: In fact, there can be multiple string keys that can generate the same hash value (in this case, 9) when processed by our hash function, get_hash.This phenomenon is known as a hash collision, and it’s the reason why we got a misleading result for march 17.\n\n# Edge case-2: add a new key-value pair\nht.add('march 17', 459)\n# Now get the value of march 6\nprint('value on march 6 is: ', ht.get('march 6'))\n\nvalue on march 6 is:  459\n\n\nOops!\nWhy are we getting a wrong value for march 6? Initially it was 310 and now it comes out as 459. Why?\nAnswer: This happened because of the same index problem that we discussed above. Since the index of both march 17 and march 6 is 9, when we added march 17’s data, it overwrote at index 9 (which was for march 6) with the new valu the new value of 459 and removed 310. That’s why we don’t see the original value. As mentioned previously, this is called as Collision\n\nTo solve both these challenges (Edge cases 1 & 2), we need to modify our code to start storing the key along with value as a tuple., We can do this by initializing the array as an array of arrays (or lists).\nBut before we implement this change, let’s first refactor our code to use Python’s standard operators like __getitem__, __setitem__, and __delitem__ to make use of HashTable more intuitive.\n\nclass HashTable:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.MAX = 10 # assume 10 is the size of dictionary\n        self.arr = [None for i in range(self.MAX)] # allocate memory\n\n    def get_hash(self, key: str):\n        \"\"\" converts a key into index (int) \"\"\"\n        total = 0\n        for char in key:\n            total+=ord(char)\n        return total%self.MAX\n\n    def __setitem__(self, key: str, value: Union[str, int]):\n        \"\"\" adds a key-value pair \"\"\"\n        idx = self.get_hash(key) # get the index for a key\n        self.arr[idx] = value    # insert value at the calculated index\n\n    def __getitem__(self, key: str):\n        \"\"\" outputs value given a key \"\"\"\n        idx = self.get_hash(key) # get the index for a key\n        return self.arr[idx]     # return the value at the calculated index\n\n    def __delitem__(self, key:str):\n        \"\"\" removes value given a key \"\"\"\n        idx = self.get_hash(key) # get the index for a key\n        del self.arr[idx]     # delete value at the calculated index\n\n\n# Let's test the code we created so far \nht = HashTable()\n# add values\nht['march 6'] = 310\nht['march 7'] = 340\nprint('after adding data', ht.arr)\n# get value\nprint('value on march 6 is: ', ht['march 6'])\n# remove value\ndel ht['march 7']\nprint('after removal of march 7: ', ht.arr)\n\nafter adding data [340, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 310]\nvalue on march 6 is:  310\nafter removal of march 7:  [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 310]\n\n\n\n\nHandling Collisions\nThere are 2 ways to handle collisions.\n\n1. Chaining:\n\nHere, we do 2 things.\n\nwe store a list at each index instead of single element (as briefly discussed earlier).\nEach element in this list is a tuple of (key, value) pair.\n\nTime complexity to retrieve an element in this case is O(n) in the worst-case, because we may need to scan through all elements in the list at a given index to find the correct key.\n\n\n2. Linear Probing:\n\nInstead of using lists at each index, linear probing handles collisions by searching for the next available empty slot in the array.\nFor eg. in the above image (LEFT), a collision occurs at index 9. To insert the key march 17, we look at the following indices one by one. Since index 9 is already occupied and it’s the end of the array, we wrap around to the beginning. We find that index 1 is empty, so we store the (march 17, 459) pair there, as shown on the RIGHT.\nNow, let’s build hash table first with Chaining technique to handle collision and then Linear Probing.\n\n\nChaining\n\nclass HashTable:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.MAX = 10 \n        self.arr = [[] for i in range(self.MAX)] # initialize list in each memory location instead of None\n\n    def get_hash(self, key: str):\n        \"\"\" converts a key into index (int) \"\"\"\n        total = 0\n        for char in key:\n            total+=ord(char)\n        return total%self.MAX\n\n    ############################################\n    # # Partially correct but Incorrect 💔 😢\n    #############################################\n    # def __setitem__(self, key: str, value: Union[str, int]):\n    #     \"\"\" adds a key-value pair \"\"\"\n    #     idx = self.get_hash(key)              # get the index for a key\n    #     self.arr[idx].append((key, value))    # append (key, value) tuple to the list\n    ### The problem with above function is - if we add same key twice with different values, it will store both (key, value) tuples.\n    ### Ideally, it should update the old value by the new balue for the repeated key.\n\n    ############################################\n    # # Partially correct but Incorrect 💔 😢\n    #############################################\n    # def __setitem__(self, key: str, value: Union[str, int]):\n    #     \"\"\" adds a key-value pair \"\"\"\n    #     idx = self.get_hash(key) # get the index for a key\n\n    #     # if there is no k-v tuple yet, simply add the k-v tuple\n    #     if len(self.arr[idx])==0:\n    #         self.arr[idx].append((key, value))\n    #         return # STOP\n        \n    #     # else check if the key exist, and if it does then remove the existing k-v tuple and then add new k-v tuple\n    #     existing_keys = []\n    #     for kv in self.arr[idx]:\n    #         k, v = kv\n    #         if k==key:\n    #             v = value # update the value -&gt; Sadly, this won't work.

    "text": "In this notebook, we will be building a Linear Regression model from scratch to learn and familiarize ourselves with various governing foundational concepts about it. For this, we will use a sklearn.datasets.make_regression function to create a simple synthetic dataset in one variable. We can extend the concepts learned here to build multi-variate linear regression models.\n\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\n\n# Generate the data\nX,y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=7, random_state=42) \n# Here, \n# X.shape: (n_samples, n_features) = (100, 1)\n# y.shape: (n_samples, ) = (100, )\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,3))\nax.scatter(X,y)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that X axis varies from -2 to 2. It implies that our feature space is already normalized.😄\nHowever, if we are dealing with multiple features, then it is common to have different features in different range. For ex. in a dataset of house price prediction, the house area can range from 100-5000 while number of bedrooms typically range from 1-5. To make the linear regression model to give equal importance to all the features, it is a good practise to bring all the features in same range. So, we normalize the features. There are multiple ways to normalize:\n\nX/max: new feature range is 0 to 1\nX-mean/std: new feature range is -3 to 3 mostly (except outliers)\n(X-min)/(max-min): new feature range is 0 to 1\n\nIn Machine Learning, whenever, we want to build any model, we usually split it into 2 sets - train and val. We build algo on train and finetune its hyperparameters to optimise the loss/error function on val set. This step is mandatory. So, let’s build a helper function\n\ndef train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):\n    \"\"\" splits the data into train and test sets\"\"\"\n\n    np.random.seed(random_state)\n    n = X.shape[0]\n\n    if isinstance(test_size, float) and test_size&lt;1:\n        test_size = int(n*test_size)\n    elif isinstance(test_size, int):\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"test size must be a float/ int\")\n    \n    shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(n)\n    test_indices = shuffled_indices[:test_size]\n    train_indices = shuffled_indices[test_size:]\n    X_train = X[train_indices]\n    X_test = X[test_indices]\n    y_train = y[train_indices]\n    y_test = y[test_indices]\n    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test\n\n\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=20, random_state=0)\nprint(f'Train size: {X_train.shape[0]}, Test size: {X_val.shape[0]}')\n\n# plot the train and val data to see the split\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,3))\nax.scatter(X_train,y_train, c='blue', label='train')\nax.scatter(X_val,y_val, c='red', label='val')\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nTrain size: 80, Test size: 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the question is how do we decide the size of val set and how we should create it?\nAnswer: There is no strict metric on how to decide the size of val set. The most important aspect to consider while creating val set is - it should be a representative of train set. This means, the points in the val set should have a good spread throughout the training data. What does this mean ? - Suppose, all val points (red) occur together and not separated from one another, then it is not a good split. Because this val data does not capture the distribution of train data and since the ultimate use of val data is to optimize the model, then it means we will end up optimizing the model only for a short spread of the data and not the entirety of it. Hence, we mostly perform random sampling to make sure that we get different and spread-out points in the hope that they would be a representative set of the entire training data. To achieve this, we can choose 20% of the data or 30% or 5% depending upon the distrubution of the data we are dealing with. Typical value is 15-25% sampled randomly. (But both the val data percentage and sampling method will vary depending upon the nature of the problem. Read more here )\nAfter creating the splits of train and val data, we can now write code to build a regression model.\n(FYI, if normalization of features is required as mentioned above, then normalization is performed after the data splitting. Various normalization constants are calculated from the train split of the data and stored for processing val and real test data that comes during the production stage.)\nWe are now writing a code for a simplistic model: yhat = wx + b\nwhere w and b are randomly initialized and\noptimized by Gradient Descent\nIn Linear regression, we use mean square error as loss function for optimiztion via Gradient Descent\n\n# hyperparameter\nlr = 0.001\nepochs = 101\n\n# initialize weights and biases randomly\nw = np.random.rand()\nb = np.random.rand()\n\n# Gradient Descent \ntrain_losses = []\nval_losses = []\nfor epoch in range(epochs):\n    # Go through TRAIN data\n    yhat = w*X_train + b\n    yhat = np.squeeze(yhat)\n    # mean square error loss\n    mse_loss = np.mean((y_train-yhat)**2)\n    if (epoch)%20==0:\n        print(f\"EPOCH: {epoch}, Train LOSS:{round(mse_loss, 3)}\")\n    train_losses.append(mse_loss)\n    # step of Gradient Descent\n    w = w - lr*(yhat-y_train)@X_train\n    x0 = np.ones((X_train.shape[0],1))\n    b = b - lr*(yhat-y_train)@x0 # or : b = b - lr * np.sum(yhat - y_train)\n    ## Monitor performance on VAL data\n    yhat = w*X_val + b\n    yhat = np.squeeze(yhat)\n    mse_loss = np.mean((y_val-yhat)**2)\n    if (epoch)%20==0:\n        print(f\"EPOCH: {epoch}, Val LOSS:{round(mse_loss, 3)}\")\n    val_losses.append(mse_loss)\n\nEPOCH: 0, Train LOSS:1567.608\nEPOCH: 0, Val LOSS:1552.406\nEPOCH: 20, Train LOSS:145.819\nEPOCH: 20, Val LOSS:168.799\nEPOCH: 40, Train LOSS:40.83\nEPOCH: 40, Val LOSS:73.231\nEPOCH: 60, Train LOSS:31.699\nEPOCH: 60, Val LOSS:68.759\nEPOCH: 80, Train LOSS:30.857\nEPOCH: 80, Val LOSS:69.459\nEPOCH: 100, Train LOSS:30.777\nEPOCH: 100, Val LOSS:69.843\n\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,3))\nax.plot(range(epochs),train_losses, c=\"b\", label = 'train loss')\nax.plot(range(epochs),val_losses, c=\"red\", label = 'val loss')\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually, you should see decreasing error/loss values. If this does not happen, few things need to be checked: 1. Reduce learning rate, lr and retry 2. Always, check if the shapes of variables are correct. For ex: bias, b shape must be (1,); w: (1, ), mse_loss: (1,), yhat: (num_samples in train/val, ) and so on. I have seen many times, while working with numpy, if you are not careful of matrix multiplication and dot product rules, the shapes of your variables become incorrect causing weird model training. You could also see an up and down behaviour in train loss. For example: If you miss to account for x0 while calculating bias b -&gt; it will cause massive shape issues throughout.\nAnyhow, for our case, we did not encounter any such strange behavior. Let’s see the model we trained:\n\nprint(f\"Linear Regression Model: wx+b = {w}*x+{b}\")\n\nLinear Regression Model: wx+b = [44.0082033]*x+[0.38012626]\n\n\n\nxmin = min(X); yhat_min  = w*xmin+b\nxmax = max(X); yhat_max  = w*xmax+b\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,3))\nax.scatter(X,y, label = 'data')\nax.plot([xmin, xmax], [yhat_min, yhat_max], c=\"red\", label='fitted model')\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trained model fits really well visually. But how do we quantify the quality of fit?\nAnswer: r2-score\nI often used to forget the formula for r2-score, until I understood the reasoning behind it and then, I no longer needed to memorize it. I could reproduce the formula within seconds by following pure logic. In fact, I feel this is the best way to also sharpen your data understanding skills. Being able to reason about the data stuff and write it in terms of maths - this is the skill that will make you a data scientist with sharp eyes and mind.\n\nr2-score forumla\nLet’s understand the r2-score and derive its formula by asking just basic questions i.e. first principle thinking.\nQ. What is the simplest model we could use without any fancy math?\nA. use mean i.e. the average as the answer, yhat for any given x\nQ. Now, if we use the simplest model, what is the sum of squares of error?\nA. np.sum((y-mean)**2)\nQ. What is the sum of squares of error from our model?\nA. np.sum((y-yhat)**2)\nQ. If we have trained a good model, it should be better than baseline (simplest model, where we predict average no matter what X is). That is, sum of squares of error from trained model &lt; sum of squares of error from simplest model. But how much better?\nA. 1 - np.sum((y-yhat)^2) /np.sum((y-mean)^2)\n\n# simplest model \nymean = np.mean(y_train) # use train to calculate the model, where model = mean\nSST = np.sum((y_val - ymean)**2) # calculte sum of square of error on val data\nprint('SST: ', SST)\n\n# trained model\nyhat = w*X_val + b\nyhat = np.squeeze(yhat)\nRSS = np.sum((y_val-yhat)**2)\nprint('RSS: ', RSS)\n\n# R2-score\nr2_score = 1-RSS/SST\nprint('r2_score: ', r2_score)\n\nSST:  37726.247861497875\nRSS:  1396.867522387115\nr2_score:  0.9629735899653908\n\n\nFor simplest model,\nmodel = ymean, sum of square of error is called SST = Total sum of squares\nFor trained model,\nmodel = wx+b, sum of square of error is called RSS = Sum of square of Residuals\nr2_score close to 1 means the model explains the data well.\nr2_score ranges from 0 to 1. Can you think what what does r² = 0 mean?"

    "text": "In this notebook, we will be building a basic decision tree to learn and familiarize ourselves with various governing foundational concepts about decision trees. For this, we will use a relatively simple dataframe containing purely numerical features for the task of classification. As our understanding about decision trees expands, we will extend the concepts learned here to handle complex and challenging dataframes (such as those with missing values, with categorical features, etc.)\nLet’s load the popular iris data. (We are using sklearn only and only to load a popular benchmark dataset. We will not use it to build decision trees. Instead, we will build our decision trees entirely from scratch in using numpy)\n\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\n\n# load the data\niris_data = load_iris()\nX = iris_data.data\ny = iris_data.target\n\n# Here X and y are numpy arrays. We do a bit of processing to convert X and y into pandas dataframe for readability\nfeature_names = iris_data.feature_names\ntarget_names = iris_data.target_names\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names) # start df with features i.e. X\ndf['target'] = y                            # add target column to df i.e. y\n\ndf['target'] = df['target'].apply(lambda x: target_names[x]) # Optional: convert integer labels to actual class names\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\ntarget\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will build a decision tree which when given 4 numerical feature values will classify the plant species as one of 'setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'.\nFor this, we first need to split the data into train and val sets. Then we will use the train set to build the model and test it on the val set.\n\ndef train_test_split_df(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):\n    \"\"\" splits the data into train and test sets\"\"\"\n\n    if isinstance(test_size, float) and test_size&lt;1:\n        test_size = int(len(df)*test_size)\n    elif isinstance(test_size, int):\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"test size must be a float/ int\")\n    \n    shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(len(df))\n    test_indices = shuffled_indices[:test_size]\n    test_df = df.iloc[test_indices]\n    train_df = df.drop(test_indices)\n    return train_df, test_df\n\n\ntrain_df, test_df = train_test_split_df(df, test_size=20, random_state=0)\nprint(f'Train size: {len(train_df)}, Test size: {len(test_df)}')\ntrain_df.head()\n\nTrain size: 130, Test size: 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\ntarget\n\n\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build a decision tree, the dataset is split into 2 subsets using a condition - where one subset satisfies the condition and another does not.\nThe condition is nothing but thresholding of one the features. (For example, condition: sepal lenghth &lt;= 4.4 cms will split the dataset into 2 subsets - one where sepal lenghth is less than 4.4 cms and another where it is not)\nThe main question here is how we decide which feature to use and what threshold to pick?\nAnswer: Pick the feature which results in most information gain.\nNow to understand the above term information gain, we need to first familiarize ourselves with few more concepts.\n\nPurity - Measure of homogenity of a subset. For ex: if a data subset contains only red balls - it is pure. But if it contains even a single green ball - it is now impure. The extent of impurity is measured using entropy.\nEntropy - calculated as:\n  H(X) = — Σ (pi * log2 pi)\n\nwhere; X = Total number of samples, and, pi is the probability of class i\nPure dataset: - One which contains elements belonging to single class. For e.g.: All red balls - For a pure dataset: entropy = 0\nMost Impure dataset: - One which contains elements distributed equally among other classes. For e.g.: 10 blue balls and 10 red balls - For the most impure subset: entropy = 1\n\nInformation Gain - If we split the dataset, then the entropy (i.e. degree of impurity) in the children subsets should ideally be lower. This reduction in entropy is the information gain.\n Information Gain = entropy (parent) — [average entropy of ( children)]\n\nNow, based on the above concepts, we will split the dataset, using the feature that results in highest information gain.\nAnd how we do this?\nAnswer: Brute Force. Yes, Brute Force… We go through all the feature columns one at a time and for each feature column, we go through all of their possible values one at a time, splitting the data into 2 children nodes, calculating information gain, storing it and then pick one which gave us the highest information gain.\nWe repeat this process, either a fixed number of times or until the entropy of children becomes zero (i.e. children subsets become pure) and then we stop.\nLet’s see this step by step…\n\n# let's check the purity of our current data\n\ndef check_purity(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if data is pure.\n    \"\"\"\n    y = df.iloc[:, -1]\n    return len(y.unique())==1\n\nprint('Is the train data pure? -&gt;', check_purity(train_df))\n\nIs the train data pure? -&gt; False\n\n\nAs it is not pure. Let’s see how much impure it is by calculating entropy.\n\ndef calculate_entropy(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the entropy of the data. Entropy =  — Σ (pi * log2 pi)\n    \"\"\"\n    y = df.iloc[:, -1]\n    values, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)\n    probs = counts/len(y)\n    entropy = -np.sum(probs*np.log2(probs))\n    return entropy\n\nparent_entropy = calculate_entropy(train_df)\nprint(f\"Entropy of parent node: {parent_entropy}\")\n\nEntropy of parent node: 1.5848773505329046\n\n\nNow, let’s see the details of how we will split the data. The code below should be very straightforward and intuitive to understand.\nAs mentioned, now (1) we will go through all features and their all possible values to split the dataset and then (2)check the information gain. SO, let’s first create the function called get_potential_splits that does (1) for us and then we will implement determine_best_split that will do (2) for us.\n\n# Function (1)\ndef get_potential_splits(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Get all the possible potential splits of the data.\n    \"\"\"\n    potential_splits = {}\n    _, n_columns = df.shape\n    for column_index in range(n_columns - 1): # -1 to skip the target column\n        values = df.iloc[:, column_index]\n        unique_values = np.unique(values)\n        potential_splits[column_index] = [] # initialize a list for storing possible split values per column aka feature\n\n        # using mid-points between 2 consecutive unique values to split the data\n        for i in range(len(unique_values)-1):\n            split_value = (unique_values[i]+unique_values[i+1])/2\n            potential_splits[column_index].append(split_value)\n        \n    return potential_splits\n\n# let's see the potential splits for our data\npotential_splits = get_potential_splits(train_df)\nprint(\"Potential splits for each feature column:\")\nprint(potential_splits)\n\nPotential splits for each feature column:\n{0: [4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75, 4.85, 4.95, 5.05, 5.15, 5.25, 5.35, 5.45, 5.55, 5.65, 5.75, 5.85, 5.95, 6.05, 6.15, 6.25, 6.35, 6.45, 6.55, 6.65, 6.75, 6.85, 7.0, 7.15, 7.25, 7.35, 7.5, 7.65], 1: [2.1, 2.25, 2.3499999999999996, 2.45, 2.55, 2.6500000000000004, 2.75, 2.8499999999999996, 2.95, 3.05, 3.1500000000000004, 3.25, 3.3499999999999996, 3.45, 3.55, 3.6500000000000004, 3.75, 3.8499999999999996, 4.0, 4.15], 2: [1.05, 1.2000000000000002, 1.35, 1.45, 1.55, 1.65, 1.7999999999999998, 2.45, 3.15, 3.4, 3.55, 3.6500000000000004, 3.75, 3.8499999999999996, 3.95, 4.05, 4.15, 4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75, 4.85, 4.95, 5.05, 5.15, 5.25, 5.35, 5.45, 5.55, 5.65, 5.75, 5.85, 5.95, 6.05, 6.199999999999999, 6.449999999999999, 6.65, 6.800000000000001], 3: [0.15000000000000002, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.8, 1.05, 1.15, 1.25, 1.35, 1.45, 1.55, 1.65, 1.75, 1.85, 1.95, 2.05, 2.1500000000000004, 2.25, 2.3499999999999996, 2.45]}\n\n\n0: above is first column i.e. sepal length (cms), 1: is second column and so on.\nNow, we have find all the possible ways to split the data (mentioned as (1))\nNow, let’s see how to get the best split by developing determine_best_split (mentioned as (2)). For this, first create a function (2-1) that will split the data into 2 parts given a feature and its value. Then, we will use this function to split the data for all possible combinations, calculate information gain and pick the one that gives highest information gain (2-2).\n\n# Function (2-1)\ndef split_data(df: pd.DataFrame, split_column: int, split_value: float) -&gt; tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]:\n    \"\"\" \n    SPlit the data into 2 subsets based on split column and split value.\n        split_column (int) : column index\n    \"\"\"\n    split_column_values = df.iloc[:, split_column]\n    left_split = df[split_column_values &lt;= split_value]\n    right_split = df[split_column_values &gt; split_value]\n\n    return left_split, right_split\n\n# Functions (2-2)\ndef determine_best_split(df: pd.DataFrame, potential_splits: dict) -&gt; tuple[int, float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the best split column and its value.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_split_column = None\n    best_split_value = None\n    best_info_gain = 0\n    parent_entropy = calculate_entropy(df) # Parent Entropy\n    \n    # (Recursive)Iterate over all possible combinations of columns and their split values\n    for column_index in potential_splits.keys():\n        for split_value in potential_splits[column_index]:\n            left_split, right_split = split_data(df, column_index, split_value)\n            average_children_entropy = calculate_average_children_entropy(left_split, right_split)\n            information_gain = parent_entropy - average_children_entropy\n            # print(\"Column:\", iris_data.feature_names[column_index], \"Split value:\", split_value, \"Information gain:\", information_gain)\n            \n            # pick the one with highest information gain\n            if information_gain &gt; best_info_gain:\n                best_info_gain = information_gain\n                best_split_column = column_index\n                best_split_value = split_value\n        \n    #print(\"Best Information Gain:\", best_info_gain)\n    return best_split_column, best_split_value\n\ndef calculate_average_children_entropy(left_split: pd.DataFrame, right_split: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the overall entropy of the data after splitting i.e. average entropy of the children nodes\n    overall entropy = weighted average of children entropies = Σ (p_c * E(c))\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(left_split) + len(right_split) # total size of data\n    w_left = len(left_split)/ n            # relative weight of left data\n    w_right = len(right_split)/ n          # relative weight of right data\n    overall_entropy = w_left * calculate_entropy(left_split) + w_right * calculate_entropy(right_split)\n    return overall_entropy\n\nAbove 2 functions should be straightforward to understand.

Thus, it would not need any further splitting.\nWhereas right_brach is not pure i.e. it contains datapoints from multiple classes. Thus, it would need further splitting.\n\nnp.unique(left_branch.target) # see classes in left_branch\n\narray(['setosa'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\nnp.unique(right_branch.target, return_counts=True)  # see classes in right_branch\n\n(array(['versicolor', 'virginica'], dtype=object),\n array([43, 44], dtype=int64))\n\n\nBased on just one condition, we can create a small subtree as follows:\nsub_tree = {\"condition\" : [\"left_split_answer\", \"right_split_answer\"]}\nIf we suppose if this small sub-tree is our final decision tree which we want to use for testing. So, if we were to classify one test_example as input, we will check it’s petal length, see if it is less than &lt;= 2.45 cm, we will return setosa as the class, else, we will pick the class with higher relative probability in the right_branch as the predicted class.\n\n# In plain english \nsub_tree = { \"petal length (cm) &lt;= 2.45\" : [\"setosa\", \"versicolor\"]} # right split is versicolor because it is dominant in right_branch\n\nAlmost Never, we create decision tree with only a single condition i.e. 2 child nodes. Usually a decision tree is composed of multiple sub-trees composing multiple conditons.\nProgramatically speaking, we repeat the process of splitting for both the left_branch and right_branch until we reach the stopping condition:\n\nchild nodes become pure\na fixed number of steps by setting hyperparameters like max_depth, min_samples, etc.\n\nNote: There should not be any doubt/confusion when I say that the condition for splitting a left_branch and right_branch belonging to same parent node could be completely different (because it depends upon the data distribution within the child node).\nLet’s build a full-fledged decision tree programatically using concepts of dynamic programming.\n\nDecision Tree code (for case 1. i.e keep splitting until child nodes become pure)N\n(Note: FYI: Case 2. i.e. splitting fo a fixed number of steps is also covered later in this notebook.)\n\ndef decision_tree_algorithm(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; dict:\n    data = df\n\n    # base case: If data is pure-&gt; stop and return the class of the child node\n    if check_purity(data):\n        predicted_class = np.unique(data.iloc[:, -1])[0] # only 1 unique value\n        return predicted_class\n    \n    # else: keep on splitting \n    # Recursive\n    else:\n        # for splitting: get_potential_splits -&gt; determine_best_split -&gt; split_data based on best_split_column and best_split_value\n        potential_splits = get_potential_splits(data)\n        best_split_column, best_split_value = determine_best_split(data, potential_splits)\n        left_branch, right_branch = split_data(data, best_split_column, best_split_value)\n\n        \n        condition = \"{} &lt;= {}\".format(list(df.columns)[best_split_column], best_split_value)\n        # create the sub-tree as a dictionary storing the condition as key and a list as the value.

(Do not pay attention to the code but to the print block)\n\nLet’s writ some code to evaluate the decision tree we built.\n\ndef classify_example(example, tree):\n    question = list(tree.keys())[0]\n    feature_name, split_value = question.split(\" &lt;= \")\n    \n\n    # ask question\n    if example[feature_name] &lt;= float(split_value):\n        answer = tree[question][0]\n    else:\n        answer = tree[question][1]\n\n    # base case\n    if not isinstance(answer, dict): # if the answer is not a dictionary, then it is a leaf node\n        return answer\n\n    # recursive case\n    else:\n        residual_tree = answer\n        return classify_example(example, residual_tree)\n    \n\ndef calculate_accuracy(df, tree):\n    df  = df.copy()\n\n    # df[\"classification\"] = df.apply(classify_example, axis=1, args=(tree,))\n    # df[\"classification_correct\"] = df[\"classification\"] == df[\"target\"]\n\n    df.loc[:, \"classification\"] = df.apply(classify_example, axis=1, args=(tree,))\n    df.loc[:, \"classification_correct\"] = df[\"classification\"] == df[\"target\"]\n    \n    accuracy = df[\"classification_correct\"].mean()\n    \n    return accuracy\n\nSince, we created sub_trees in an uninhibited manner, it will result in perfect train accuracy.\n\ncalculate_accuracy(train_df, my_tree)\n\n1.0\n\n\nLet’s check the test accuracy\n\ncalculate_accuracy(test_df, my_tree)\n\n1.0\n\n\nSurprisingly! It also resulted in the perfect test accuracy\n\nControl the depth and min_samples in a decision tree\nIn the above case, we got test accuracy of 100%. But usually this is not the case because datasets are more complex.\nIf we allow the decision tree to grow unhibited manner then it overfits where it is possible that every leaf node would only have one data point. This is not a good decision tree because then prediction from such a tree becomes highly sensitive to small fluctuations in the data.\nHence, now we modify our code to pre-prune the tree i.e. limit its growth using max_depth and min_samples as the hyperparamters\n\n\n\nDecision Tree code (for case 2. i.e. splitting fo a fixed number of steps)\nBefore we write the actual code, we need a function to get the majority class label of the set if the subset is not pure but further splitting is not possible because stopping condition is reached.\n\ndef get_majority_class(df: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Classify the data.\n    \"\"\"\n    y = df.iloc[:, -1]\n    return y.mode()[0]\n\n\ndef decision_tree_improved(df: pd.DataFrame, counter = 0,  min_samples=2, max_depth=5) -&gt; dict:\n\n    data = df\n    # base case: If data is pure or we hit max_depth or min_sample condition violates-&gt; stop and return the class of the child node\n    if check_purity(data) or (len(data) &lt; min_samples) or (counter == max_depth):\n        predicted_class = get_majority_class(data) \n        return predicted_class\n    \n    # else: keep on splitting \n    # Recursive\n    else:\n        counter+=1\n        # for splitting: get_potential_splits -&gt; determine_best_split -&gt; split_data based on best_split_column and best_split_value\n        potential_splits = get_potential_splits(data)\n        best_split_column, best_split_value = determine_best_split(data, potential_splits)\n        left_branch, right_branch = split_data(data, best_split_column, best_split_value)\n\n        \n        condition = \"{} &lt;= {}\".format(list(data.columns)[best_split_column], best_split_value)\n        # create the sub-tree as a dictionary storing the condition as key and a list as the value.

I will also perform testing and debugging of the code to show how we read errors, understand and debug them. This is going to be a long blog but quick to read since most of the code is copy pasted multiple times within the notebook.\n\n# type hints\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\nA Linked List is made up of nodes, where nodes contain data and a pointer to the next node.\n\nLet’s create a Node class which will have 2 attributes: data & a pointer to the next node\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next = next\n\nLet’s build a LinkedList in baby steps.\nFirst, we will build 2 functions in linked list. One to create a linked list by adding data and another to print it so that we can visualize and debug.\nclass LinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n        pass\n\n    def print(self):\n        pass\nOnce we build the above class with 2 simple functions - insert_at_beginning and print, it will be much simpler to complete the remaining functions to add different functionalities to LinkedList\nclass LinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n        pass\n\n    def print(self):\n        pass\n\n    def insert_at_end(self, data):\n        pass\n\n    def insert_values(self, data_list):\n        pass\n\n    def get_length(self):\n        pass\n\n    def insert_at(self, index):\n        pass\n\n    def remove_at(self, index):\n        pass\nIt is important to realize whether inputs are required for creating any function. If not, why not. If yes, what type of inputs.\nLet’s get started.\nConcepts: \n\nWe will add data by creating Nodes.\nWe use head to control any operation on Linked List we want to perform.\n\nhead is an object always pointing towards the start of the linked list. (head means top/start)\n\n\nclass LinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # head is an object always pointing towards the head i.e. start of the linked list\n        self.head = None # Step-1: initialize head to none. this will be updated once we add data to the linked list\n\n    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n        # In insert_at_beginning, we add element at the start of the linked list\n        \n        node = Node(data, self.head) # Steps-2&3: create a node with data and next pointer to the current head\n        self.head = node             # Step-4: update the current head to the new node just added       \n\n    def print(self):\n        # to print we iterate on the node starting from the first node\n        itr = self.head\n        if itr.data is None:\n            print(\"Linked List is empty\")\n        llstr = \"\"\n        while itr:\n            llstr+=str(itr.data)\n            llstr+='--&gt;'\n            itr = itr.next\n        print(llstr)\n\n\n# Let's test the code we created so far by creating a linked list and adding elements at the beginning\nll = LinkedList()\nll.insert_at_beginning(292)\nll.insert_at_beginning(301)\nll.print()\n\n301--&gt;292--&gt;\n\n\n\n# let's test for an edge case of empty list\nll = LinkedList()\nll.print()\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[11], line 3\n      1 # let's test for an edge case of empty list\n      2 ll = LinkedList()\n----&gt; 3 ll.print()\n\nCell In[9], line 15, in LinkedList.print(self)\n     12 def print(self):\n     13     # to print we iterate on the node starting from the first node\n     14     itr = self.head\n---&gt; 15     if itr.data is None:\n     16         print(\"Linked List is empty\")\n     17     llstr = \"\"\n\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'data'\n\n\n\nWe are getting an AttributeError because we are trying to refer an attribute data that does not even exist for an empty list. So, issue is for an empty list. It is so because empty list contains None element as head (self.head = None). You can see the topmost figue in insert at beginning. This None head does not have data attribute.\nSo, we need to change the code slightly and condition over the self.head to check for an empty list\n\nclass LinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # head is an object always pointing towards the head i.e. start of the linked list\n        self.head = None # Step-1: initialize head to none. this will be updated once we add data to the linked list\n\n    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n        # In insert_at_beginning, we add element at the start of the linked list\n        \n        node = Node(data, self.head) # Steps-2&3: create a node with data and next pointer to the current head\n        self.head = node             # Step-4: update the current head to the new node just added       \n\n    def print(self):        \n        # edge case: if ll is empty\n        if self.head is None:\n            print(\"Linked List is empty!\")\n        # to print we iterate on the node starting from the first node\n        itr = self.head\n        llstr = \"\"\n        while itr:\n            llstr+=str(itr.data)\n            llstr+='--&gt;'\n            itr = itr.next\n        print(llstr)\n\n\n# let's test for an edge case of empty list\nll = LinkedList()\nll.print()\n\nLinked List is empty!\n\n\n\nGreat! this works as expected.

    "title": "Stack Made Easy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this notebook, we will understand what stack is, where we interact with stack it our daily lives and how can we build a stack in Python.\nBefore understanding what stack is, let’s see 2 most common examples of our daily life interaction with a stack which is now an integral part of modern day lives with computers, tablets and smartphones.\nInternet browsing - Suppose we are browsing the pages of a news channel CNN. Initially we are at their homepage - cnn.com, then we went to read news in the Entertainment section - cnn.com/entertainment, on this page we want to read about celebrities - cnn.comentertainment/celebrities and now we want to go back to the homepage (cnn.com) and read the news in the business world - cnn.com/business. Stack is the underlying data structure which stores our browsing history and provides a convenient way for us to go back or forward from our existing page to a page that has been visited in the past.\n\nUndo/Redo operations - If we are writing text in word document, we can conveiently press Ctrl + Z to undo or Ctrl+Y to redo becuase we are storing the user operations in a stack so that user experience is enhanced where it becomes extremly simple to either undo a change or redo it.\nWe can build stack in python by 2 ways: 1. List - okay but not ideal 2. Deque - better\n\n1. Stack using List\n\nbrowsing_history_stack = [] # initialize an empty list to store browsing history\n\nbrowsing_history_stack.append('cnn.com')\nbrowsing_history_stack.append('cnn.com/entertainment')\nbrowsing_history_stack.append('cnn.com/entertainment/celebrities')\n\nprint('browsing history: ', browsing_history_stack)\n\n# If we want to revisit the last browsing page: use pop\nprint('Last page visited was: ', browsing_history_stack.pop())\n\n# pop removes the last page and updates the browsing_history_stack\nprint('new browsing history: ', browsing_history_stack)\n\nbrowsing history:  ['cnn.com', 'cnn.com/entertainment', 'cnn.com/entertainment/celebrities']\nLast page visited was:  cnn.com/entertainment/celebrities\nnew browsing history:  ['cnn.com', 'cnn.com/entertainment']\n\n\nQ. Why a List is not ideal for storing the browser history i.e. a Stack?\nAnswer History is dynamic - There is no fixed size of history. In a session, a person can browse 5 websites or 50000. There is no limit. Hence, static arrays or list cannot be used thus, dynamic array is the only option. But with dynamic array there is memory overload problem.\n“The issue with using a list as a stack is that list uses dymanic array internally and when it reaches its capacity it will reallocate a big chunk of memory somewhere else in memory area and copy all the elements. For example in below diagram if a list has a capacity of 10 and we try to insert 11th element, it will not allocate new memory in a different memory region, copy all 10 elements and then insert the 11th element. So overhead here is (1) allocate new memory plus (2) copy all existing elements in new memory area.”\n\n\n\n2. Stack using deque\nRead documentation about deque here.\n\nfrom collections import deque # import deque\n\nstack = deque() # initialize a stack\n\ndir(stack)      # read what different methods are present with a deque class object\n\n['__add__',\n '__class__',\n '__class_getitem__',\n '__contains__',\n '__copy__',\n '__delattr__',\n '__delitem__',\n '__dir__',\n '__doc__',\n '__eq__',\n '__format__',\n '__ge__',\n '__getattribute__',\n '__getitem__',\n '__getstate__',\n '__gt__',\n '__hash__',\n '__iadd__',\n '__imul__',\n '__init__',\n '__init_subclass__',\n '__iter__',\n '__le__',\n '__len__',\n '__lt__',\n '__module__',\n '__mul__',\n '__ne__',\n '__new__',\n '__reduce__',\n '__reduce_ex__',\n '__repr__',\n '__reversed__',\n '__rmul__',\n '__setattr__',\n '__setitem__',\n '__sizeof__',\n '__str__',\n '__subclasshook__',\n 'append',\n 'appendleft',\n 'clear',\n 'copy',\n 'count',\n 'extend',\n 'extendleft',\n 'index',\n 'insert',\n 'maxlen',\n 'pop',\n 'popleft',\n 'remove',\n 'reverse',\n 'rotate']\n\n\nNotice, deque has many similar attributes to that of list like append, insert, pop, remove, index. It means using deque stack is going to be exactly same as if we are handling a list object.\n\nstack = deque() \n# add browsing history\nstack.append('cnn.com')\nstack.append('cnn.com/entertainment')\nstack.append('cnn.com/entertainment/celebrities')\n\n# Use of deque is same as a list\nprint('browsing history: ', stack)\nprint('Last page visited was: ', stack.pop())\nprint('new browsing history: ', stack)\n\nbrowsing history:  deque(['cnn.com', 'cnn.com/entertainment', 'cnn.com/entertainment/celebrities'])\nLast page visited was:  cnn.com/entertainment/celebrities\nnew browsing history:  deque(['cnn.com', 'cnn.com/entertainment'])\n\n\nCan we index in or slice a deque stack?\n\nprint(stack[1]) # indexing\nprint(stack[:2])# slicing\n\ncnn.com/entertainment\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[35], line 2\n      1 print(stack[1]) # indexing\n----&gt; 2 print(stack[:2])\n\nTypeError: sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'\n\n\n\nWow!😮\nSo, with deque stacks, we can :\nperform indexing ✅\nbut slicing ❌\nQ. How to perform slicing?\nAns. Possible solutions:\n\nconvert stack to list. For eg: list(stack)[:2]\nget one element at a time in the index range, aggregate and return the aggregated results\n\n\n\nWriting a Stack class\nWhile writing a Stack class, we first need to think what functionalities/methods we want our Stack class to support.\n\nWe want to add elements i.e. push\nWe want to get last element i.e. pop\nWe want to get the size of the stack (e.g. browsing history)\nWe want to see if the stack is_empty\nWe want to see the last element in the stack i.e. peek\nget last_k_items\nprint the current stack i.e. printStack\n\n\nclass Stack:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.container = deque()\n\n    def push(self, item):\n        self.container.append(item)\n    \n    def pop(self):\n        return self.container.pop()\n    \n    def size(self):\n        return len(self.container)\n    \n    def is_empty(self):\n        return self.size()==0\n\n    def peek(self):\n        return self.container[-1]\n    \n    def last_k_items(self, k=5):\n        return list(self.container)[-k:]\n    \n    def printStack(self):\n        \"\"\"print the stack from bottom to top \"\"\"\n        # make a copy because pop operation would remove elements in place\n        temp = self.container.copy()\n        stack_str = \"\\n\" # initialize a string to print stack\n        stack_str+=\"**--\"\n        # edge case: if stack is empty\n        if len(temp)==0:\n            stack_str+='\\n⚠ Stack is empty'\n        \n        while len(temp)!=0: \n            stack_str+=f\"\\n{str(temp.pop())}\"\n\n        stack_str+=\"\\n--**\"\n        return stack_str\n\n\nbrowsing_stack = Stack() \n# add browsing history\nbrowsing_stack.push('cnn.com')\nbrowsing_stack.push('cnn.com/entertainment')\nbrowsing_stack.push('cnn.com/entertainment/celebrities')\n\n# Test methods\nprint('1. browsing history: ', browsing_stack.printStack())\nprint('2. Last page visited was: ', browsing_stack.pop())\nprint('3. new browsing history: ', browsing_stack.printStack())\nprint('4. Length of history: ', browsing_stack.size())\nprint('5. Is browsing history empty? : ', browsing_stack.is_empty())\n\n1. browsing history:  \n**--\ncnn.com/entertainment/celebrities\ncnn.com/entertainment\ncnn.com\n--**\n2.

Is browsing history empty? :  False\n\n\n\n\nFrom above we can convince easily that the time complexity of Stack is as follows:\n\nIn different languages, Stack can be implemented as follows:\n\n\n\nExercise-1: Write a function in python that can reverse a string using stack data structure (use the Stack class implemented above.)\nreverse_string(\"We will conquere COVID-19\") should return \"91-DIVOC ereuqnoc lliw eW\"\nHint: Treat each character as a browing history item. So our goal is to print browsing history in reverse order\n\n\nShow solution code\ndef reverse_string(string):\n    # initialize a stack\n    mystack = Stack()       \n\n    # push one character at a time\n    for char in string:\n        mystack.push(char)\n\n    reversed_str = \"\"\n    for i in range(mystack.size()):\n        reversed_str+=mystack.pop()\n    return reversed_str\n\n\nreverse_string('We will conquere COVID-19')      \n\n\n'91-DIVOC ereuqnoc lliw eW'\n\n\n\n\nExercise-2: Write a function in python that checks if paranthesis in the string are balanced or not.
